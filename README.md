# AI API Comparison Guide 🤖

> An honest, developer-focused comparison of OpenAI and Anthropic APIs - built by a developer, for developers.

## 🎯 Why This Guide Exists

I spent weeks working with both OpenAI and Anthropic APIs, digging through docs, debugging issues, and burning through API credits. This guide shares what I learned so you don't have to.

**This is NOT marketing material.** It's real experiences, actual code, and honest comparisons.
